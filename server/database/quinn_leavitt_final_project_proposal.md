 1. Name of the game
 
  Brutal Brawler

 2. Short description of gameplay

  The game will be a top down hack and slash game with just different kinds of punches. Clicking down on the mouse will result in a sequence of punches and slowly move the character forward. The character will face in the direction that the mouse is in. The character will also be able to block and potentially parry attacks to get cooldown resets. The character will have several special abilities: An uppercut, a ground slam, and a charged up punch that launches the character through enemies. I think it'd be the most fun if the character can combo these abilities together while dodging and blocking attacks. I might be able to have different randomized powerups or detriments that get lost if you lose a run to add replayability if I have time.

 8. List of core features: 

  Basic enemy pathing
  Auto attacks
  Mouse aiming
  Player movement
  Special abilities
  Player Health
  Enemy Health
  Enemy attacks/abilities

    * These are things you **must** have for the game to be complete in a basic way.
    * You should have a clear idea of you think you should be able to implement these, or have a 
      plan for figuring them out / asking for help about them early in the project.

 9. List of secondary features: 
  
  Bosses
  Roguelike elements(abilities/effects that only last for the current run)

    * These are things that are still important, but not as critical enough to be 'core'.
    * It's best if you have a rough idea of how these would work as well, but you can get away with
      them being a bit less well-defined - if they fall through, you still have your core game intact.

 10. List of bonus features: 
  
  Music
  Screenshake from impact of hits

     * These are things that would be nice to have, but are definitely non-essential. After 'core' 
       and 'secondary' features are complete, these take priority.

 11. Realistic goals/expectations for the ~4 weeks of work on the project

  Week 1: I'd like to have the player controller and some abilities done
  Week 2: I'd like to have a few enemy types and health done
  Week 3: I'd like to have enemy attacks done and begin working on art
  Week 4: I'd like to be finalizing art, adding music and polish.
